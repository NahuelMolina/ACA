# CRUD
That web app allow us to Insert, Read, Update and Delete information on our database
## To resume
This's a basic CRUD using the database NoSQL/NoRel MongoDB
## Usage
I create a branch named boot_frontend, you can add it localy
```bash
git remote add boot_frontend https://github.com/NahuelMolina/CRUD-mongodb.git
```
pull it on yor local repository
```bash
git pull https://github.com/NahuelMolina/CRUD-mongodb.git boot_frontend
```
This way, you can work on views folder and all changes you realize will would be saved
